##### License and Code of Conduct
* This code is licensed the "Academic Free License version 3.0"
* The CoC that we chose was the "Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct"

###### Why This License and CoC
* We chose to use the Academic Free License Version 3.0 because it allows our code to be "open source," but still gives us as the creators the credit. It allows people to freely make their own edits to their own version of our program. They can distribute and market it but we are ultimately the creators. We are also not liable for anything they do.
* We chose to use the Contributor Covenant CoC due to the fact that it was written with the express purpose of maintaining a positive and collaborative open source environment. The values of this CoC reflect our values in how we would like our code to be treated, and how we want our contributors to be treated. It describes what you can or cannot add in our workspace, the standards that we hold contributors to, as well as the scope of the CoC.
